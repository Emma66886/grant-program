### Overview

Please provide the following:
- VeFunds is a web3 crowdfunding platform where users, projects and organisations can request funding from supporters or community and funds releasing will be based on community/donators votings per milestone depending on the settings which will be well visible to the community and donators.
- I am highly interested in building this project on the VeChain due to it trusted and proven ecosystem,easy to interact blockchain and great community support.
- This project will be a full fledge blockchain so the connex library will be of a great tool to connect and interact with the platform smart contract and wallets. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
1. To show my level undertanding of the project, I have built and deployed the simplest version of the project on the veChain testnet. live link is https://vefunds.vercel.app/
2. For Images and videos content, I have decided to host it on bunny.net but currently users will have to submit the link to the image so rendering is currently direct from users hosted image
3. For cheaper storage fee(gas fee), the project will have onchain and off chain management.

### Ecosystem Fit
Yes, a similar project is gitcoin but gitcoin does not provide full onChain management and didn't give authority to donators per project
