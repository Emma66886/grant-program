### Overview

Please provide the following:
- VePub is a revolutionary web3 publishing platform where content creators can earn cryptocurrency for their articles, videos, and other media, while readers and viewers can also earn for engaging with that content. This decentralized platform provides a secure and transparent way to monetize content, giving power back to creators and rewarding consumers for their attention. With a seamless user interface and a wide variety of content available, this platform is changing the way we interact with digital media.
- I am highly interested in building this project on the VeChain due to it trusted and proven ecosystem and great community support.
- This project will be a full fledge blockchain so the connex library will be of a great tool to connect and interact with the platform smart contract and wallets. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
1. To show my level undertanding of the project, I have built and deployed the blog version of the project on the Binance testnet
link is https://lblog-ten.vercel.app/
2. For Images and videos content, I have decided to host it on bunny.net
3. For Contents so as to cut low of executions fees while interacting with the blockchain by the content writters/publishers, I have decided to bring content off chain 
4. For seamless and faster interaction, the project will have onchain and off chain management

### Ecosystem Fit
Yes, a similar project is 0XPublish but 0xPublish only give room for bloggers while my project gives room for both bloggers and other content providers
